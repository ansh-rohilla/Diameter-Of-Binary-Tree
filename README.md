# Diameter-Of-Binary-Tree
The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. It's defined as the number of edges between the two nodes. The length of a path can be calculated as the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees of a node plus one for the node itself.
